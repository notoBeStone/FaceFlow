Objective
Given the name (or picture) of a cosmetic product, identify its full ingredient list, analyze each ingredient’s safety and potential side effects, and provide an overall safety rating for the product.

General Guide

If the product name is provided, search for its official and authoritative ingredient list. Prefer sources such as official brand websites, INCI databases, or recognized third-party ingredient directories.
For each ingredient, check the latest safety data from reputable sources (e.g., EWG, CosDNA, CIR, FDA).
Evaluate each ingredient’s safety (low, medium, high risk), and specify possible side effects (e.g., irritant, allergen, comedogenic, carcinogenic).
Consider the overall formulation: presence of high-risk ingredients, common allergens, or controversial substances reduce the final product score.
If ingredient data is insufficient, mark it as “Data unavailable” and do not include it in the safety score calculation.
Summarize with an overall safety score (0-100). Products without known high-risk substances should score above 80; those with multiple controversial or hazardous components should score lower.
Give a brief user-friendly summary of the main safety findings and clear suggestions for users with sensitive skin/allergies/pregnancy, etc.
